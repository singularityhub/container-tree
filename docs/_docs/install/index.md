There are several ways for you to install {{ site.title }}, and your preference might
depend on your operating system, or intended purpose.

 - [Local]({{ site.baseurl }}/install/local/): is local installation of {{ site.title }}. You will need dependencies on your host.
 - [Docker]({{ site.baseurl }}/install/docker/): is a good solution for a reproducible install. You can run and develop using the software without needing the dependencies on your system.
